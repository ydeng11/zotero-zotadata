## Installation

### From XPI File (Zotero 7.x)

1. Download the latest release XPI file
2. In Zotero 7, go to `Tools` ‚Üí `Add-ons`
3. Click the gear icon and select "Install Add-on From File..."
4. Select the downloaded XPI file
5. Restart Zotero

**Note**: This extension requires Zotero 7.0 or later. For Zotero 6.x compatibility, use an earlier version of this extension.

### Manual Installation (Development)

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run `./build.sh` to create the XPI package
3. Install as described above

## Configuration

1. Right-click on any item in your Zotero library
2. Select `Zotadata` ‚Üí `Configure Email`
3. Enter your email address (required for Unpaywall API)

**Note**: Your email is stored locally in Zotero preferences and only used for API requests to services like Unpaywall. The plugin will prompt you for an email the first time you use features that require it.

## Usage

### Context Menu

Right-click on selected items in your Zotero library to access:

- **Validate References**: Check and clean up attachments for selected items - removes broken file links while preserving valid PDFs and weblinks
- **Update Metadata**: Fetch and update metadata for journal articles, conference papers, preprints, and books using multiple APIs (CrossRef, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, OpenLibrary, Google Books) - can auto-discover missing DOIs/ISBNs
- **Retrieve Files**: Search and download missing PDF files from multiple sources (Unpaywall, arXiv, CORE, Library Genesis, Sci-Hub, Internet Archive) - only processes items without existing PDFs
- **Process Preprints**: Handle arXiv papers by finding published versions, updating metadata, downloading published PDFs, or converting to proper preprint format when no published version exists

### Batch Operations

Select multiple items to process them all at once. A progress dialog will show the status of each operation.

## Success Rates & Expectations

### PDF Retrieval Reality

File retrieval success varies significantly by source type:

**High Success Rate:**
- **arXiv Preprints**: Very reliable due to arXiv's open access mandate and stable infrastructure
- **Open Access Articles**: Good success via Unpaywall for legitimately open access content

**Moderate to Low Success Rate:**
- **Paywalled Journal Articles**: More challenging due to publisher restrictions and legal considerations
- **Books**: Particularly difficult to obtain, especially recent publications
- **Recent Papers**: Sci-Hub has significantly reduced new uploads due to ongoing legal challenges

### Alternative Workflows

For difficult-to-find content, consider these community-recommended approaches:

1. **Anna's Archive**: A promising source with about 5-minute wait time for link generation, but it is free.
2. **Google**: Google is always our friend as the resource might be shared in reddit, github or some niche forums.

**Note**: This plugin automates the search across legitimate and widely-used academic sources. For content not available through these channels, manual research through additional academic resources may be necessary.

## API Integration

This plugin integrates with several external APIs and services:

### Metadata APIs

## Development

### Requirements

- Zotero 7.0 or later
- Firefox 115+ based platform

### Building

1. Make changes to the source files
2. Run `./build.sh` to create XPI package
3. Test in Zotero 7 development environment

### Testing

- Unit test the API integration functions
- Test with various item types and DOI formats
- Verify UI responsiveness and error handling
- Test with both Zotero 7 stable and beta versions

## Zotero 7 Migration

This version has been completely rewritten for Zotero 7 compatibility:

- **Extension Format**: Migrated from `install.rdf` to `manifest.json`
- **Architecture**: Changed from XUL overlays to bootstrapped extension
- **APIs**: Updated to use Zotero 7 compatible APIs
- **Window Management**: Adapted to new Zotero 7 window lifecycle
- **Preferences**: Moved to root-level `prefs.js` file

## Zotero 7 Compatibility Notes

When developing this plugin for Zotero 7, ensure the following in your `manifest.json`:

- **`manifest_version`**: Must be set to `2`. Despite Zotero 7 being based on a newer Firefox core that uses Manifest V3 for web extensions, Zotero's own bootstrapped plugins still expect `manifest_version: 2`.
- **`applications` key**: Zotero-specific properties (like `id`, `strict_min_version`, `strict_max_version`, and `update_url`) must be within an `applications.zotero` object.
- **`update_url`**: This field within `applications.zotero` is **mandatory** for Zotero 7.0.15+ (and possibly earlier Zotero 7 versions). Even for local development, a placeholder URL (e.g., `"https://example.com/update.json"`) must be provided, otherwise the plugin installation will fail with an "Extension is invalid" error.

Failure to include `update_url` will result in an error message in the Zotero debug log similar to:
`ERROR Loading extension 'your-plugin-id@example.org': Reading manifest: applications.zotero.update_url not provided`
